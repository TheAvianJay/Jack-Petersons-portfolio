# Overview

Here is a software program I have been working on to help improve my talent that I have in software engineering. This is where I experiment with functions and ideas that come to mind when I am working on these programs

The software are simple when you look at them here from a simple choose your own adventure to a program that keeps track of peoples bank information and keeps track of how long  they spent on the system before leaving along with data on the date and time in which they accessed the bank account.

The purpose of me creating these software is to demonstrate what kinds of programs I can make and the many factors I take into consideration.

Here is a video demo of a very simple program.
